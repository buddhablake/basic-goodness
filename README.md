## Approach taken

### Brand

The idea behind Basic Goodness was to create a Etsy-like online store with a focus on artist made kitchen goods. It was important that the artist was visible and that the buyer knew who they were buying from. Basic Goodness believes that artisan made kitchenware has a life of its own and adds another level of richness to the cooking and dining experience.

### Functionality

Basic Goodness serves as a reminder to slow down and enjoy the simple things; the UI/UX are a reflection of that reminder. There are very few choices for either user or artist to make, allowing the focus to be on the beautiful products instead of the site itself.

## User Stories

### User

Users have the option of creating an account or beginning to explore the products and artists right away. Users can view products by collection, or view all products made by a particular artist.

### Artist

Artists have the same capabilities as users plus their profiles have a biography field and a profile picture field, both of which are required. Once an artists creates their account and logs in they are given the ability to add a new product to their store. Each artist is given the ability to edit and/or delete any of their products at any time. Artists may also update their profile information when needed.

## Unsolved Problems

### Shopping Cart

This was a time problem more than anything, but obviously a store is only a store if the user has the ability to buy things. This feature will be added in the future.

### Error Handling

It didn't take me long to realize that good error handling is an art in and of itself. I could have easily spent a week or more on error handling alone.
